# Automatic Door Unlock

The project deals with Door Locks where we develop a set up using RFID reader and a NODEMCU. RFID reader reads signal 
from tags and if it matches then the door will unlock else it will remain locked.

## Scope of work:
RFID Door Lock is useful in offices or colleges. RFID tags can be attached to Identity cards. So doors will only unlock 
with correct tags and access can be denied to unauthorized persons.

## Importance:
Security is major issues these. Hence it is required to secure premises with adequate solutions. This project is a 
great step in this direction with requirement of minimal and cheap hardware available in market.

## Conclusion and Future Work

We have just made a model that uses small servo motor for door rotation. In further modifications we can add higher 
power motor so that actual door can be rotated.

All the scanning process can be automated with help of deep learning with notifications coming on user smartphone 
instead of web browser.
