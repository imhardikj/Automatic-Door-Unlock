The project deals with Door Locks where we develop a set up using RFID reader and a NODEMCU. RFID reader reads signal 
from tags and if it matches then the door will unlock else it will remain locked RFID Door Lock is useful in offices or 
colleges. RFID tags can be attached to Identity cards. So doors will only unlock with correct tags and access can be 
denied to unauthorized persons. A RFID Door Lock can be used to secure premises. It will open only when correct tags 
are used.
